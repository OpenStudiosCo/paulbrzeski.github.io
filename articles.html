        <h3>Windows 10 Review</h3>
        <p>Fuck. That is a good word to describe this operating system and I hope that this article takes your mind off some of the crap we are all putting up with at home and at work. Windows 10 has been great for Apple, that’s for sure.</p>

        <h3>Set Raytracers to Maximum</h3>
        <p>So I was casually watching a Youtube video about dogfighting in space. They made a great point that guns on fighters should be close instead of far apart — this is something that I struggled to design for when..</p>

        <h3>How deep is the river if you cannot see the bottom?</h3>
        <p>Upgrading your computer isn’t too hard — you work out where you can get good gains or if the whole setup needs a replacement. Unfortunately the latter option isn’t available for the human brain.</p>

        <h3>Creating good tools for a brave new world</h3>
        <p>I’m building a 2D/3D hybrid graphic design tool called Manifold. In this article I’m going to discuss the approach I’m taking in order to fit it into the workflow that I need for building games. I see this problem from a “recipe” perspective — what do I want the process to look like and what tools do I need to execute it.</p>

        <h3>My angel is the manifold</h3>
        <p>Naming is the most important decision in a new open source project. It needs to convey a meaning, be ubiquitous, unique, low GI, etc. <br>I’m coming up to the 5th anniversary of developing Langenium and I’m actually further away from a playable game than the early days of the project.</p>

        <h3>In order to save time, you must first invent the universe</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest parts of developing a 3D game is coming up with assets such as models, textures and even concept art itself. This is especially hard if you suck at 3D modelling and frankly don’t have time for it.</p>
