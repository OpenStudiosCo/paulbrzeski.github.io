                p It probably won't surprise you that I'm of Polish descent, the name is a dead give away. My father is Polish and my mother is Filipino, so I'm actually mixed race.
                p Born in Australia, I was fortunate to spend some of my youth in my parents home countries - attending parts of primary and high school overseas. This exposure to different cultures and viewpoints was formative to my worldview of humanism.
                p I wrote my first programs in DOS at age 11 and haven't looked back. I like loud music, fun video games and indulgent snacks. In my downtime I work on my projects, ride my bicycle and wonder about stuff.
