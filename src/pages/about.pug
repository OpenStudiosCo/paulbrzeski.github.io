                p Born in sunny Perth Western Australia, I was fortunate to spend some of my youth in my parents home countries - attending a mix of private and public schools. This exposure to different cultures and viewpoints was formative to my worldview of humanism.
                p I didn't have a lot of friends or toys as a kid but at the age of six I got a PC. Using books from the public library I was able to teach myself to write software code by age eleven. At twenty, without any formal education, I got my first job as a programmer.

                p Free and Open Source is as much a way of thinking as it is a software licensing scheme, as such I strive to be accountable, transparent, informative and useful to others in all business interactions and activities.
