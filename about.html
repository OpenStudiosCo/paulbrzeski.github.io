            <p>It probably won't surprise you that I'm of Polish descent, the name is a dead give away. My father is Polish and my mother is Filipino, so I'm actually mixed race.</p>
            <p>Born in Australia, I was fortunate to spend some of my youth in my parents home countries - attending parts of primary and high school overseas. This exposure to different cultures and viewpoints was formative to my worldview of humanism.</p>
            <p>I wrote my first programs in DOS at age 11 and haven't looked back. I like loud music, fun video games and indulgent snacks. In my downtime I work on my projects, ride my bicycle and wonder about stuff.</p>
            <h2 class="ui dividing header">History</h2>
            <p>Starting as a data entry clerk for an ISP called Westnet, I found myself understanding the systems around me and quickly ascended in the ranks to become a supervisor within the Provisioning team. Liaising with developers in that capacity led me to realize I could pursue my programming interests as a career.</p>
            <p>After quitting the call center, I went to TAFE however my course got cancelled halfway through the year. I was fortunate that a customer at the cafe I worked in needed help with a shopping cart. I fixed the bug with ease and was offered my first full time job as a programmer.</p>
            <p>Over a decade later, I have a combination of experiences as both a web developer in agency environments and software engineer in a corporate environment. I am proud of having a countless list of completed projects and examples of good work and value given to my employers and clients alike in that time.</p>
